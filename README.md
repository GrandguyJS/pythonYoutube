Please do not use this code in any way or form that violates the Youtube agreement and could give others a disantvantage. This is only used for experimental purposes and not to steal others content on purpose.
Before executing the code you have to create an account at the google cloud website:
Then:

1. Enable the YOUTUBE DATA API

2. Create the OAUTH SCREEN and an API_KEY

3. Insert the API_KEY in Secrets/Secret.json

4. Get a CHANNELID of a channel by going to https://commentpicker.com/youtube-channel-id.php and inputing a username

5. Input this CHANNELID into SECRETS/Secret.json

6. run python get.py

If you want to visualize the content:

THEN:

1. Copy the JSON to the JSON variable in website.js

2. Open main.html

ENJOY!

Code still isn't optimized.
For the geeks:

You can directly rewrite the python code to js so you don't have the copy the JSON or you could use Flask.
Either way it would be a huge upgrade!
